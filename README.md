# analysis-of-entropy
- This program is for the probabilistic and entropy-based analysis of cancer related mutations that segregate in tumors with high or low expression of a gene of interest.
- Notes in the code indicate parameters that may be modified (lines 2, 8, 9, 25, 95, 181). 
- Consensus file of cancer related mutations should be downloaded as a TSV file from https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/census (sign in is required). TSV file should be stored in the working directory and name of the file should be adjusted in line 25.
